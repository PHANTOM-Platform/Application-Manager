Each PHANTOM tool may be notified when their dependences are solved (those depences become "completed"="true")
I will define an interface for such diferent notifications or queries a common interface for everybody, where just specify the set of steps to be completed, Similar as we did for the Execution Manager.



The idea is to follow the steps:

1- The USER confirms that the source code is completely uploaded TO the APP-MANAGER
2- PT and MBT know step 1 is completed=true (the be notified or they query the app-manager)
3- The IP core generator may run when "pt" is completed=true.
4- MOM may run when the previous steps are completed="true"
10- I think MBT whats that 2b will run again, then it trigers to run again, right?
    In such case can set "completed"="waiting" for "mbt_early_validation",
    which will trigers a notification to MOM when "mbt_early_validation" become "completed"="true"


- “waiting” - tool waiting for some tool our resource to be available 
- “started” - tool started its activity
- “finished” - tool finished its activity
- “error” - tool encountered an error
- "not_required"--
